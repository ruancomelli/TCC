# Undergraduate Thesis

The LaTeX project for my undergraduate thesis entitled "Fundamentos do Método de Elementos Discretos (DEM) e sua Aplicação à Simulação da Dinâmica de Partículas Esféricas", which can be freely translated as "Fundaments of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and it's Application to the Simulation of Spherical Particle Dynamics".

This undergraduate thesis was a result of the implementation of a C++ Discrete Element Method library: [PSIN](https://github.com/ruancomelli/PSIN).
